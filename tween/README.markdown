Tween
======

Before you can build _something_ using [tween.js](http://threejs.org/), you have to understand the API.  Based on books, 
research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is [js fiddle] (http://jsfiddle.net/).  If I am unfamiliar 
with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the framework, then step one is to build and publish a fiddle (or 
fiddles) until it makes sense.  Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand alone application that 
*fiddles* with a specific piece of the tween.js framework.


### Using fiddle.sh ...

#### Create

_TBW_

    fiddle.sh "create" "tween" "fiddle-####-<name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle/poc.
