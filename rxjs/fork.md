RxJS (fork)
======

Executing the command `./fiddle.sh "fork" "rxjs" "0000" "fiddle-0100-Fork"` from the `scripts` directory produces
the following output.


    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-FORK.SH
    FIDDLE-INDEX.SH
    09-29-16
    Done. All "rxjs" fiddles have been re-indexed.
    Done. The "../../fiddles/rxjs/fiddle-0100-Fork" directory has been initialized.


Note, when a `rxjs` fiddle is `forked`, the `fiddle.sh index rxjs` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root rxjs [index.html](index.html) page.
