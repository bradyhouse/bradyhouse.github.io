    Done. All "rxjs" fiddles have been re-indexed.
    Done. The "../../fiddles/rxjs/fiddle-0100-Fork" directory has been initialized.


Note, when a `rxjs` fiddle is `forked`, the `fiddle.sh index rxjs` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root rxjs [index.html](index.html) page.
