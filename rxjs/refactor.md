RxJS (refactor)
======

Executing the command `./fiddle.sh "refactor" "rxjs" "0000" "fiddle-0100-Refactor"` from the `scripts` directory produces
the following output.

      {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
      FIDDLE.SH
      FIDDLE-REFACTOR.SH
      FIDDLE-INDEX.SH
      09-29-16
      Done. All "rxjs" fiddles have been re-indexed.
      Refactor process completed successfully.
      "fiddle-0000-Template" is now "fiddle-0100-Refactor".
      

Note, when an `rxjs` fiddle is `refactored`, the `fiddle.sh index rxjs` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root angular [index.html](index.html) page.
