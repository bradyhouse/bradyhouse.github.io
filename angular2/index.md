    Done. All "angular" fiddles have been re-indexed.


This command rebuilds the [index.html](index.html) page based on the angular2 fiddle collection. Provided the fiddle
is not listed in the [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) file and includes a root `index.html` file, then a link to it's
root `index.html` page is added to the collection's [index.html](index.html) page.
