### Description

An Angular2 Fiddle exploring how to--

 1. Create a _Vertical Bar Chart_ using _straight_ D3
 2. "Subscribe" to an observable in order to get some json
 3. In the callback (2), populate a D3 chart (1)

The chart should realize the following requirements:

    *  x axis should use an ordinal scale and be labelled along the bottom
    *  y axis should use a linear scale and rendered along left side of the chart
    *  series bars should have a linear gradient
    *  colors used in the gradient should be defined in a separate css file
    *  the width and height of the chart should be based on the dimension of the window
    *  the dimensions of the chart should refresh on window resize
    *  the y axis should use a custom scale based on the values proximity to a fixed value (aka tolerance)
    *  the chart should have two quadrant for plotting positive and negative y values
