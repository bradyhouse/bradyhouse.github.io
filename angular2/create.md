    Done. The "../fiddles/angular2/fiddle-0000-Template" directory has been initialized.

    Done. All "angular2" fiddles have been re-indexed.
    

Note, when an `angular2` fiddle is created, the `fiddle.sh index angular2` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root angular [index.html](index.html) page.

### Additional Info

[Angular2](../angular2) fiddles are created to simply run in the browser.  This means, the resulting sandbox can
be hosted using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or any type of vanilla web server
package. The contents of the sandbox is based entirely on the contents of the [template](template) directory.
