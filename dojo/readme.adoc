= Dojo

Before you can build a website using the link:http://dojotoolkit.org/api/[Dojo toolkit], you have to understand the
toolkit.  Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is link:http://jsfiddle.net/[js fiddle].
If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the framework, then step one is to build and
publish a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense.  This directory is dedicated to exploration of this framework.
The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
