### Title

House jQuery Fiddle - fiddle-0040-FabricJs


### Creation Date

### Location

Chicago, IL


### Issue

[Issue 54](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/54)


### Description

I just spent 2 weeks of my free time (after 5 and weekends) writing [SVG fiddle 27](http://bradyhouse.github.io/svg/fiddle-0027-ImageCloud/index.html).  After publishing the
fiddle, I then tried opening it from my iphone -- blank screen.  Straight SVG doesn't actually work on mobile devices.
According to [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3889882/svg-support-on-android), you need to use a
polyfill that converts the SVG to an HTML5 canvas.  [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/) is one such library.
And so, time for another fiddle.
