Bootstrap 4 ColumnPaging

### Issue

[Issue 251](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/251)


### Description

Okay, in bootstrap 3.7.1, the carousel control can be used to create a horizontal paging mechanism for a collection of 
cols-* controls.  This strategy, however, doesn't seem to work in bootstrap 4.1.3.  Even if you swap "carousel-item" for
"item", the carousel behaves differently.  I therefore need to find a way around this...  As starting point, see this 
[Bootstrap 4 Carousel](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_carousel.asp) example.
