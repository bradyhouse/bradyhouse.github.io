### Description

Fiddle exploring the solution to the [Code Fight Sudoku](https://codefights.com/arcade/intro/level-12/tQgasP8b62JBeirMS) 
problem:

    Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each 
    row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
    
    This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.
    
    Example
    
    For the first example below, the output should be true. For the other grid, the output 
    should be false: each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids should contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
