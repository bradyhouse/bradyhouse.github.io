### Description

Fiddle exploring the solution to the [Code Fight Mine Sweeper](https://codefights.com/arcade/intro/level-5/ZMR5n7vJbexnLrgaM) problem:

    In the popular Minesweeper game you have a board with some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement of mines we want to create a Minesweeper game setup.
    
    Example
    
    For
    
    matrix = [[true, false, false],
              [false, true, false],
              [false, false, false]]
    the output should be
    
    minesweeper(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                           [2, 1, 1],
                           [1, 1, 1]]
