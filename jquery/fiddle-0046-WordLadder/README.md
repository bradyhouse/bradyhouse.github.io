### Description

Fiddle exploring the solution to the [Code Fight WordLadder Problem](https://codefights.com/interview/EDaACHNYHyH6qQFAL):

    Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a wordList of approved words, find the length of the shortest 
    transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord such that:
    
    Only one letter can be changed at a time
    Each transformed word must exist in the wordList.
    Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if no such transformation sequence exists.
    
    Note: beginWord does not count as a transformed word. You can assume that beginWord and endWord are not empty and 
    are not the same.
    
    Example
    
    For beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", and wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"], the output should be
    wordLadder(beginWord, endWord, wordList) = 5.
    
    The shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog" with a length of 5.
