### Title

House jQuery Fiddle - fiddle-0039-MomentJs


### Creation Date

08-01-16


### Location

Chicago, IL


### Issue

[Issue 53](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/53)


### Description

A week doesn't go by when I don't encounter a date formatting issue.  In the modular NPM world, date formatting
requires a [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) dependency.  As I am new to moment.js, a fiddle is in order.
In particular, I need a simple fiddle that demonstrates all of the different format strings supported by moment.js.
To keep things simple, the fiddle should use the [NPM CDN copy of moment.js](https://npmcdn.com/moment@2.14.1/).
