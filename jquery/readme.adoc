= JQuery (Bootstrap / ES6)

Before you can build something with jQuery and twitter bootstrap, you have to understand jQuery and twitter bootstrap.
Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is link:https://jsfiddle.net[jsFiddle].
If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of these frameworks, then step one is to build
and publish a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense. This directory is dedicated to exploration of jQuery, bootstrap
and straight ES6.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table
outlines how.
