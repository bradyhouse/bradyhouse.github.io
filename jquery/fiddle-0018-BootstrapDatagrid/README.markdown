### Title

Bootstrap Datagrid


### Creation Date

06-09-15


### Location

Chicago, IL


### Description

Fiddle exploring how to create a bootstrap styled data grid. Additionally, it explores one way around the CORS/AJAX issue.  In this case, an externally hosted script (js file) is used to inject 471 stringified (serialized) JSON objects into the DOM.  These are then parsed (deserialized) and consumed.
