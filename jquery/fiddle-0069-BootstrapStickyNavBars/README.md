### Issue

[Issue 257](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/257)


### Description

This fiddle demonstrates how to add a sticky header (and footer) bar to a page using bootstrap 4. It
also explores how to use CSS media blocks to control which navbars are visible depending on the browsers screen 
width. Finally, it answers another bootstrap question: _How do you center multiple form controls within a navbar 
while also having elements right and left justified without using a table?_ Ok, it's a boring one, but critical 
to understand when designing across devices.
