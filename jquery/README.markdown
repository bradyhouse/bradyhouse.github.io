JQuery
======

Before you can build something with jQuery and twitter bootstrap, you have to understand jQuery and twitter bootstrap.  
Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is [jsFiddle] (https://jsfiddle.net).  

If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of these frameworks, then step one is to build 
and publish a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense.  Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand 
alone application that *fiddles* with a specific piece (or pieces) of these frameworks.


#### Using fiddle.sh ...

_TBW_

    fiddle.sh "create" "jquery" "fiddle-####-<name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle/poc.
