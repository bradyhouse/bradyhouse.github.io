### Issue

[Issue 241](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/241)


### Description

I need a canvas based fund raising thermometer control, that can become the basis of a Custom Jive Tile.  
The thermometer should include a configurable Goal and Donation inputs.  It should include 
validations tied to the input amounts.  The amounts must be numeric and greater than zero.
