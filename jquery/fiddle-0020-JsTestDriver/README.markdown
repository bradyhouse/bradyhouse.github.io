### Title

JsTestDriver _HelloWorld_


### Creation Date

06-21-15


### Location

Chicago, IL


### Description

Fiddle based on Christian Johansen's JsTestDriver examples discussed in chapter 3 of his book, <i><b>Test-Driven JavaScript Development</b></i>.
This fiddle was also used to _inaugerate_ the new "test" function (command parameter) that has been added to the [scripts/fiddle.sh](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/tree/master/scripts) script.  Provided, you
are using a Mac (OS X 10.3.3) loaded with chrome and have setup the $JSTESTDRIVER_HOME environment variable (as described in the aforementioned book),
you can invoke the tests/test.js script from the command line using the command:

    ➜  scripts git:(master) ✗ ./fiddle.sh "test" "jquery" "fiddle-0020-JsTestDriver"

This will produce the output depicted above.
