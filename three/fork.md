    Done. All "three" fiddles have been re-indexed.
    Done. The "../../fiddles/three/fiddle-0100-Fork" directory has been initialized.


Note, when a `three` fiddle is `forked`, the `fiddle.sh index three` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root three [index.html](index.html) page.
