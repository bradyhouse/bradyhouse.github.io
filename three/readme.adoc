= Three.js

Before you can build a website using link:http://threejs.org/[three.js], you have to understand the API.  Based on books, 
research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is link:http://jsfiddle.net/[js fiddle].  If I am unfamiliar
with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the framework, then step one is to build and publish a fiddle 
(or fiddles) until it makes sense.  This directory is dedicated to exploration of this framework.  The `fiddle.sh` script
can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
