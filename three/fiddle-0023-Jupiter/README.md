### Description

I just want build stuff using three.js.  Really, that's all I think about lately.  So for fun, how about a simple model 
of Jupiter in 3D Space.  Just clone [fiddle-0006-Saturn](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/tree/master/fiddles/three/fiddle-0006-Saturn), and switch out the images.  
Sad, but a simple, quick, starting point to satiate the curiosity.
