Scalar Vector Graphics
======

All modern browser support scalar vector graphics (SVG) markup.  _What, what, what?_
Consult [the source of all knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), 
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction), and then proceed directly to the 
bookstore (aka Amazon).  I am currently reading a book by David Dailey, Jon Frost and Domenico Strazzullo entitled
[Building Web Applications with SVG (Developer Reference)](http://amzn.com/0735660123).  As a starting point, this directory
contains fiddles inspired by this text.


### Using fiddle.sh ...

#### Create

[SVG](../svg) fiddles are created to simply run in the browser.  This means, the resulting sandbox can
be hosted using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or any type of vanilla web server
package. The contents of the sandbox is based entirely on the contents of the [template](template) directory.

To create a new svg fiddle, run the following command from the [scripts](../../scripts) directory like so:

    ./fiddle.sh "create" "svg "fiddle-####-<Name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle.

If everything is working correctly, you should see a stream of output that looks like this [sample create output](create.markdown).
