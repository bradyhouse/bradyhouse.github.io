Scalar Vector Graphics
======

All modern browser support scalar vector graphics (SVG) markup.  _What, what, what?_
Consult [the source of all knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), 
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction), and then proceed directly to the 
bookstore (aka Amazon).  I am currently reading a book by David Dailey, Jon Frost and Domenico Strazzullo entitled
[Building Web Applications with SVG (Developer Reference)](http://amzn.com/0735660123).  As a starting point, this directory
contains fiddles inspired by this text.
