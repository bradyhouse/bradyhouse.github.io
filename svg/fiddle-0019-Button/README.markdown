### Title

SVG Button


### Creation Date

### Location

### Description

Fiddle exploring how to create a reuseable button component that is rendered in SVG instead of HTML.  On the surface, it  looks like a bunch of buttons rendered in SVG. Underneath, its a bit more.  Each button is an instance of an ES6 class.  The class utilizes a design pattern similar to EXTJS  complete with controller style mixins in order to organize (sub-divide) the various event handlers.
