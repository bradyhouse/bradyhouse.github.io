= SVG

All modern browser support scalar vector graphics (SVG) markup.  _What, what, what?_
Consult link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics[the source of all knowledge], 
link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction[MDN].  This directory is dedicated to exploration
of integrating JavaScript and SVG. The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following 
table outlines how.
