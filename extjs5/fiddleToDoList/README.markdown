### Title
~ ToDo List

### Description
There are 15+ "ToDo List" fiddles.  Most are incomplete or don't work. 
This one works--it's complete.  It is adapted from Sencha's Kitchen Sink Cell Editing Example.  
Beyond maintaining the delete icon,it is a full refactor with a few tweaks.  
Of note, it persists user's input via local storage.
