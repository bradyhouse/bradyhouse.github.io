### Title

Dynamic Field filtering


### Creation Date

04-08-15


### Description

Fiddle exploring (or exploiting) the logic exposed in the Ext.grid.header.Container > getColumnMenu method. Specifically, this logic has been adapted (hacked) to create an external, column (or field) selection menu. Based on the user's selection in the field drop-down, a secondary filtering (or search) combo is dynamically reconfigured to point to the alternate field.  Note - This fiddle also illustratesthe use of chained stores. The search combo is attached to a standard data store while the grid is bounded to a chained store copy. When the search criteria changes, a filtered is applied to the chained store leaving the original data store unaffected. This means that the search drop-down list remains unaffected by the filter applied to the grid.
