      Are you sure you want to delete this fiddle? [Y/n]


Enter `Y` and press [Enter].  This will produce the following output:

        FIDDLE-INDEX.SH
        09-29-16
        Done. All "extjs5" fiddles have been re-indexed.
        The "fiddle-0000-Template" extjs5 fiddle has been deleted successfully.
        
        
Note, when a `extjs5` fiddle is deleted, the `fiddle.sh index extjs5` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will remove the reference to the fiddle from the root extjs5 [index.html](index.html) page.
