### Title
Fiddle ~ Grid Excel Export "Wrapper" Plugin

### Description

Fiddle exploring how to define a plugin for the grid panel that listens for the "itemcontextmenu" event.  When 
the event fires, the plugin opens a context menu that includes an "Export to Excel" command. Clicking the menu item 
fires an "excelexport" event in the panel. In the associated handler a call to the appropriate web service
can be initiated to return an excel file based on the contents of the panel.
