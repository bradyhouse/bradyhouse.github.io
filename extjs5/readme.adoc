= ExtJS 5

Before you can build a website using ExtJS, you have to understand ExtJS.  Based on books, research, and trial and
error, the best approach I have found is link:https://fiddle.sencha.com/#home[Sencha Fiddle].  If I am unfamiliar with or
(simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the framework, then step one is to build and publish a fiddle (or fiddles)
until it makes sense.  This directory is dedicated to exploration of this framework.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used
to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
