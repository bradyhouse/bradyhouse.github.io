Aurelia
======

The final lecture given by the keynote speaker at the [2016 NFJS Angular 2 Summit](https://angularsummit.com/conference/chicago/2016/05/home),
introduced a new framework called [Aurelia](aurelia.io). ... _Yah-dah, yah-dah, yah-dah_ ... [aurelia](http://aurelia.com/) fiddles.


### Using fiddle.sh ...

#### To Create

[Aurelia](../aurelia) fiddles are created to simply run in the browser.  This means, the resulting sandbox can
be hosted using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or any type of vanilla web server
package. The contents of the sandbox is based entirely on the contents of the [template](template) directory, which
are based on (for now ...) the _hello world_ example published on [plnkr.co](http://plnkr.co/edit/5vMoxM?p=preview).

To create a new aurelia fiddle, run the following command from the [scripts](../../scripts) directory like so:

    ./fiddle.sh "create" "aurelia "fiddle-####-<Name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle.

If everything is working correctly, you should see a stream of output that looks like this [sample create output](create.markdown).
