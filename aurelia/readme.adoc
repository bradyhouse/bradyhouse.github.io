= Aurelia

The final lecture given by the keynote speaker at the link:https://angularsummit.com/conference/chicago/2016/05/home[2016 NFJS Angular 2 Summit],
introduced a new framework called link:aurelia.io[Aurelia]. This directory is dedicated to fiddles involving my exploration of
this framework. The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
