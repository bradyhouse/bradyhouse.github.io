    Done. All "aurelia" fiddles have been re-indexed.


Note, when an `aurelia` fiddle is created, the `fiddle.sh index aurelia` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root aurelia [index.html](index.html) page.


### Additional Info

[Aurelia](../aurelia) fiddles are created to run in the browser.  This means, the resulting sandbox can
be hosted using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or any type of vanilla web server
package. The contents of the sandbox is based entirely on the contents of the [template](template) directory, which
are based on (for now ...) the _hello world_ example published on [plnkr.co](http://plnkr.co/edit/5vMoxM?p=preview).
